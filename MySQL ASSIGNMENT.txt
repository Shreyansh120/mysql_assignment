Assignment-1 --- Create two tables: EmployeeDetails and EmployeeSalary.

Columns for EmployeeDetails: EmpId FullName ManagerId DateOfJoining City && Columns for EmployeeSalary: : EmpId Project Salary Variable
mysql>CREATE TABLE EmployeeDetails (
    EmpId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FullName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ManagerId INT,
    DateOfJoining DATE,
    City VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE EmployeeSalary (
    EmpId INT,
    Project VARCHAR(255),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Variable DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmpId) REFERENCES EmployeeDetails(EmpId)
);


1.SQL Query to fetch records that are present in one table but not in another table.

mysql> SELECT EmpId FROM EmployeeDetails WHERE EmpId NOT IN (SELECT EmpId FROM EmployeeSalary);


2.SQL query to fetch all the employees who are not working on any project.

mysql>SELECT ed.FullName FROM EmployeeDetails ed LEFT JOIN EmployeeSalary es ON ed.EmpId = es.EmpId WHERE es.EmpId IS NULL;


3.SQL query to fetch all the Employees from EmployeeDetails who joined in the Year 2020.

mysql>SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails WHERE YEAR(DateOfJoining) = 2020;


4.Fetch all employees from EmployeeDetails who have a salary record in EmployeeSalary.

mysql>SELECT ed.FullName FROM EmployeeDetails ed INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary es ON ed.EmpId = es.EmpId;


5.Write an SQL query to fetch a project-wise count of employees.

mysql>SELECT Project, COUNT(EmpId) as EmployeeCount FROM EmployeeSalary GROUP BY Project;


6.Fetch employee names and salaries even if the salary value is not present for the employee.

mysql>SELECT ed.FullName, IFNULL(es.Salary, 0) as Salary FROM EmployeeDetails ed LEFT JOIN EmployeeSalary es ON ed.EmpId = es.EmpId;


7.Write an SQL query to fetch all the Employees who are also managers.

mysql>SELECT ed.FullName FROM EmployeeDetails ed INNER JOIN EmployeeDetails ed2 ON ed.EmpId = ed2.ManagerId;


8.Write an SQL query to fetch duplicate records from EmployeeDetails.

mysql>SELECT ed.EmpId, ed.FullName FROM EmployeeDetails ed INNER JOIN (SELECT EmpId, COUNT(*) as count FROM EmployeeDetails GROUP BY EmpIdHAVING COUNT(*) > 1) ed2 ON ed.EmpId = ed2.EmpId;


9.Write an SQL query to fetch only odd rows from the table.

mysql>SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails WHERE EmpId % 2 = 1;


10.Write a query to find the 3rd highest salary from a table without top or limit keyword.

mysql>SELECT DISTINCT SalaryFROM EmployeeSalary es1WHERE 3 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary)FROM EmployeeSalary es2WHERE es2.Salary > es1.Salary)ORDER BY Salary DESC;
